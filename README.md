# Data Tagging via Content & Standards
Data tagging is used for classification, arrangement and organization of data by assigning admin and descriptor tags. These metadata tags makes discovery easy in data catalogs. The goal of project is to extract clear, segregated and meaningful tags from text that allow the organization to automate the process of organizing their data inventory while maintaining DCAT standards.
