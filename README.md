# Data Tagging via Topics in Content
Data tagging is used for classification, identification, arrangement and organization of content of data. This tagging can be in the form of words, images or some identifying marks which makes it easy to find all data points and characteristics that are related to each other. This tagging is usually in the format of key-value pairs and can be done manually or automatically. It helps to answer ad-hoc queries easily and efficiently. Our project will be mainly focused on text tagging based on content and standards.
